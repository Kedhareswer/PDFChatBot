# PDFChatBot

## My Learning Journey with PDF Chat Interactions

This project represents my attempt to understand and implement a basic PDF chatbot system. While it's not the most advanced solution available, it serves as a learning exercise and a foundation for future improvements.

---

## About the Project

PDFChatBot is a simple browser-based application that allows users to:
- Upload PDF documents
- Extract and process text content
- Ask questions about the document
- Get basic summaries and keyword highlights

---

## Current Implementation

The project leverages:
- **PDF.js** for document handling
- **Basic keyword matching** for answers
- Simple context retrieval
- Browser-local processing (no server required)

---

## Limitations

This is a learning-focused project, and I want to acknowledge the current limitations:
1. No advanced NLP or ML models.
2. Basic keyword-based answer generation.
3. Limited context understanding.
4. No long-term memory or document comparison.
5. Browser-only processing may struggle with large PDFs.
6. Lacks vector embeddings or semantic search capabilities.

---

## What I Learned

Through this project, I gained insights into:
- Challenges in PDF text extraction
- Basic context matching algorithms
- UI/UX considerations for chat interfaces
- Document processing limitations
- Importance of proper text segmentation

---

## Future Improvements

Planned enhancements include:
- Integration with LLM models
- Implementation of a vector database
- Improved text chunking strategies
- Advanced context retrieval mechanisms
- Multi-document support
- Server-side processing
- Embedding models for semantic search

---

## Better Alternatives

For production use, consider more advanced solutions:
- [LangChain PDF tools](https://www.langchain.com/)
- OpenAI GPT with embeddings
- Claude by Anthropic
- Enterprise solutions like [Unstructured.io](https://unstructured.io/)

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kedhareswer/PDFChatBot.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser.  
   No additional installation is required as it's browser-based.

---

## Usage

1. Open the application in your browser.
2. Upload a PDF file (drag & drop or click to upload).
3. Wait for processing.
4. Start asking questions about the document.
